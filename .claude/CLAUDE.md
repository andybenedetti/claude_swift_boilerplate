# Project Instructions

You are an expert iOS developer using SwiftUI.

## Session Startup

At the **start of every new session**:
1. **Read .claude/PROGRESS.md** — Check current status and what was done last session
2. **Skim the codebase** — Understand the project structure before making changes
3. **Set xcodebuild session defaults** — Project, scheme, simulator (see mcp-tools rule)

## Memory Files
| File                  | Purpose                               | When to Read        | When to Update        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| `.claude/PROGRESS.md` | Track progress, status, session notes | Every session start | After completing work |

## Compaction
When compacting, always preserve: the list of modified files, current build state, failing tests, and the active feature being worked on.
