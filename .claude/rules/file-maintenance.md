# File Maintenance

## .claude/PROGRESS.md
- **Keep**: Current status, what's working, next steps, session notes
- **Update**: After each session with what was accomplished
- **Format**: Concise summaries — not detailed code documentation

## .claude/rules/project-architecture.md
- **Keep**: Project structure, file locations, architecture decisions
- **Update**: When files are added/moved or architecture changes
- **Purpose**: Know where everything lives without exploring

## CLAUDE.md + rules/
- **Update**: When project conventions change or new patterns are established
- **Purpose**: Ensure consistent behavior across sessions
